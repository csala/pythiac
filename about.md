<h4 class="pb-5 text-center">We dream of a world where safe AI Systems assist humanity in every aspect of our lives.</h4>

**Pythia** was the name of the high priestesses of the **Temple of Apollo**, at Delphi, also known
as the **Oracle of Delphi**. She relayed Apollo's messages to her visitors forecasting the future
and counseling about how to achieve a desired outcome.

As a modern **Pythia**, our mission is to deliver the latest state-of-the-art computer science
research achievements to the world as Applied AI Systems and Technologies ready to assist humanity
in every aspect of our lives.
